Project Title
Project Insight: University Course Data Analyst (UCDA)

Problem Statement
University faculty and administrators require efficient, reliable tools to analyze large volumes of student performance data (grades, scores). Current manual methods are slow, error-prone, and prevent timely identification of critical academic trends, such as courses with high failure rates or significant grading biases.

Scope of the Project
The UCDA project is a Python command-line utility designed to ingest course-related data from standardized CSV files, perform essential statistical analysis, validate data integrity, and generate clear, exportable reports and visualizations. It focuses on the core tasks of data cleaning, statistical summarization, and graphical representation of student grades.

Target Users
University Faculty: To quickly analyze their course performance and identify students needing intervention.

Department Administrators: To track overall course health, compare performance across different sections, and inform curriculum planning.

High-Level Features (Functional Requirements)
Data Ingestion and Validation (F-100): Loads data from CSV, validates schema and data types, and cleans missing values.

Statistical Reporting (F-200): Calculates mean, median, standard deviation, and identifies low-performing students based on a defined threshold.

Visualization Export (F-300): Generates grade distribution histograms and course-wise box plots for visual trend analysis.
